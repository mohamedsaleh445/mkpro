     A nut is a fruit consisting of a hard or tough nutshell protecting a kernel which is usually edible.
    In general usage and in a culinary sense, a wide variety of dry seeds are called nuts,
    but in a botanical context "nut" implies that the shell does not open to release the seed (indehiscent). </td>
